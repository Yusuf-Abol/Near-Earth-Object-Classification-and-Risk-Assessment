# Near-Earth-Object-Classification-and-Risk-Assessment-
Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids or comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth. Many originate in the asteroid belt but are gradually displaced by gravitational interactions or collisions. Tracking and assessing these objects require precise data collection and continuous refinement of their trajectories.
